# AWS Secure Website Infrastructure

This repository contains Terraform code for building a secure, scalable website infrastructure on AWS. The project includes:

- VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones  
- NAT gateway, route tables, and security groups  
- EC2 instances in private subnets (frontends)  
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) targeting private instances  
- Modular Terraform architecture  

I am actively working on this project and will continue to update it as time allows.
